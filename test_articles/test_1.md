"What should I say other than 'Thank you?'" the elf said taken aback by her gift.
It really was a beautiful little device, doing exactly what he hoped for.
He opened it and was hit by a sweet fragrance emitted by what must have been its heart.
"And you really don't want anything in return?"

"Your smile is already more than I could have asked for.", she returned with an expression equally mesmerizing.
"I hope it will bring peace to your mind."
